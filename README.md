## Description

A simple counter as a review, as we transition back to JavaScript after working with Java the last few weeks. The idea was to include an async function and a synchronous one to demonstrate the differences in how they run. Having a little fun too. When it's something new every day sometimes it's good to go back to the basics so they don't get lost along the way.
